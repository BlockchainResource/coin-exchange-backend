* but can also act as a standalone exchange that can be used with
* different asset classes.
* Coin Exchange uses state of the art technologies such as ASP.NET REST API,
* AngularJS and NUnit. It also uses design patterns for complex event
* processing and handling of thousands of transactions per second, such as
* Domain Driven Designing, Disruptor Pattern and CQRS With Event Sourcing.
