# Coin Exchange Backend

## Introduction
The platform acts as cryptocurrency exchange server to be used for retail and institutional trading. It can be accessed by any front end or mobile service comsuming the provided REST API.

## Context
The product serves as platform for trading different digital currencies. Currently following trading currencies are supported out of the box.

- Bitcoin
- Litecoin

The platform will mostly be a self contained product with not much integration required with external system(s). However, the billing module will have to support some different mechanisms for depositing and withdrawing money into user accounts that may include:

- Bitcoin deposit / withdrawal
- Litecon deposit / withdrawal

## Problem Statement
Cryptocurrency market has been on rise in the recent years and has become a popular financial entity. The crypto market is decentralized it's not being controlled by any single authority offering more control to the users. Some of the cryptocurrencies can also be used by setting a fixed supply cap making them more imune to inflation. This makes the cryptocurrency market highly profitable.

## Solution
To gain profit from cryptocurrency market apart from investing in trading cryptocurrencies itself one can take advantage from market liquidity by creating their own cryptocurrency exchange. Creating a cryptocurrency exchange offers the advantage of being a part of the cyrpto market itself and one can take advantage of the transaction fees to generate revenue.
